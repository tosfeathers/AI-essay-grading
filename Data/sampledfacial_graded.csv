CC6D67F4D925,"I do not think that the use of this technology in a classroom is valuable. I think the use of this technology is pointless and a waste of money, in a classroom atleast.

One reason I do not agree with the use of this computer software in a classroom is because the software doesn't understand everything that we are feeling inside. People don't always put on a face when they are feeling some type of emotion, rather they can just sit there expressionless and still feel angry, sad, or happy. I do not think this software is advanced or accurate enough to tell what we're feeling.

Another reason I find this software useless in a classroom is about learning cirriculum in the classroom. In the article it said that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"". How is the software supposed to know what we are learning, how we are supposed to learn about it, and how would the software modify the lesson to make it less confusing or more interesting? I think the software would be less useful than an actual human being teacher, because a teacher can explain and help you with something when you're confused, and not have to worry about modifying the lesson which could cause everyone to be at a different level of understanind of the lesson.

My final reason I do not agree with the use of this technology in a classroom is about the cost, and is it even nessasary? Since this software is new and advanced for facial coding, I would assume it would be very expensive. The use of this system to me, is just a waste of money, and is basically making teachers less useful and interactive with their students. A teacher is the one who should make decisions on how to teach a lesson or how to help a student, rather than a computer software that doesn't know what a person is thinking just because of their facial expression.

In conclusion I do not agree with using this technology in a classroom to help students with their learning. This software may be useful in other situations, but to me, in a classroom it is useless along with a waste of the schools money.

Then another reason is because if the kids got stuff read to them everytime how are they going to think how the book or article is about they need to read it on there own so they can understand whats going on every second threw the book or article they are reading id u let technology take over reading how are we going to learn make kids read the books and articles and they will have fun doing it.

This is were i got the evendince from to support my awnser were i got it from is pargraph three why. Because they had computers involed saying they made this thing called FACS (Facial Action Coding System) what is does is makes a human face takes it to the computer and put it on there like a real face and it put expresions and muslces in the face to make it very real looking.

Nothing cause no body really cares about it except computer geeks and gamers its a waste of our time we could be useing to do help full thing like saving people and feeding the homeless in this world, or getting a job or creating something better or full filling your dreams.

To sum this thing all up is. Lets make the kids read there own books and articles cause they will learn something new everyday, not bye letting technology read to them let them read so they can under stand and learn cool boring things so they can go home and tell mom,dad,grandma, and grandpa what they learned today.

3236876CE120,"Should the Facial Action Coding System be used in a classroom environment? Would being able to tell a students emotions help with giving them the lesson? I think it would for a few different reasons.

I think the Facial Action Coding System should be used inside and outside the classroom. It would help the teachers know what is going on inside the students heads. In which then they could give the lesson in a way that the students could feel better about their work. This also would help the teachers know what may be happening in he students lives. The Facial Action Coding System could also be used to look at pictures of people and see what their emotions were when that picture was taken. The Facial Action Coding System could and should also be used at everyday jobs. It would let the employees boss/bosses know what emotions they are feeling while working. Which would then let their boss/bosses know whether to fire them or change their work environment. Which in the long run would lead to happy, not as upset, or any other positive emotions the employees could have.

The Facial Action Coding System should definitly be used in classrooms, and even in the workforce. I think this technology should be released to the public as soon as possible. Even though most people can read others facial expressions just by looking at their face.",3,233,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions.

3F224B1AF963,"A new technology, known as the Facial Action Coding System, was developed by Doctor Paul Eckman. This system attempts to decipher human emotions, which is simply unneeded. The technology detects movement of the 44 muscles in a human face and uses this to label the emotion the person is feeling. In a classroom, this technology is not valuable because humans already calculate emotions more accurately and quickly than the Facial Action Coding System, because common comptuers cannot use the software, and because the system would needlessly waste class time.

First, this technology is completely pointless because humans already calculate emotions quicker and more accurately than the Facial Action Coding System. The only thing the system does it add an extra step to calculating emotions. In the article, it says ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.""

With the new technology, the computer creates a model of the face, detects movement of muscles on the face, then compares the expression on the face to a neutral face, then after all of that, it finally tells you how the person is feeling.

Why would a person look at a computer to learn what another person is feeling when he or she could do it? This can be applied to the classroom because teachers can tell how their students are responding to a particular lesson. For example, teachers call on students who are not paying attention just to get their attention. Teachers do not need this new technology because they are already great at sensing when a student is confused or bored.

In addition, this technology would be hard to put in classrooms around the United States because it cannot work on a common computer. In the article, it states ""your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" This means that in order to put the Facial Action Coding System into schools nationwide, new computers would be needed which would cost a great amount of money that simply is not worth is. As it is, schools already run tight budgets so the money that is needed for the new technology would take away from other neccessities that schools need. The teachers of schools that have the system would have to be trained on how to use it, not to mention the Technology Department employees. Frankly, the ends do not justify the means in this situation.

Finally, the technology would waste a great amount of class time, for no good reason at all. Multiple times throughout my day at school, teachers cannot figure out how to turn on the Smartboard or projector to teach a lesson. How would the Facial Action Coding System be any different? Teachers struggle to use simple technology like Smartboards or projectors, so using the Facial Action Coding System would just be asking for more problems. The amount of class time that would be wasted trying to set up the system would be ridiculous. As is, my teacher teach until the bell rings, and any wasted time would be time wasted that could be used for teaching.

Although the Facial Action Coding System is a cool new technology, it would not be valuable to classrooms. This technology is pointless because humans already can calculate emotions base on facial expressions. In addition, the system would be hard to implement into classrooms nationwide because the system cannot work on a common computer. Finally, class time would be needlessly wasted. Simply put, the classroom is better off without the Facial Action Coding System.

49E85AF686E1,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author is decribing how a new technology: the Facial Action Coding System, is enabling computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology: to read the emotional expressions of students, is not valuable. Even though human have simaliar muscles to show the same emotion each one does vary a great significance.

In paragraph 6 of the article Dr. Huang made a bold prediction ""A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" This means to him that a students emotions can be completly read by a computer scan. This doesn't seem logical in any means at all. Have you ever watched your classmates facial expression change from confused to them understanding completely in the blink of an eye? Im sure you have. If a computer reads your confused facial emotion in the middle of a lesson right before you understand it, it will change making you have to reset your brain to relearn what you were the the bridge of mastering.

In paragraph 5 a sentence contradicted the article ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait,"" if this is true then why would an artifical intelegence be able to read emotions better than a human who experiences the similar emotions? A real life example is when someone is really good at looking like they don't care. This is a hard face to read because some people just naturally have it at all times. With a piece of simple technology how would the scan be able to look past the same face with the same emotion at all times? It most likely couldnt and would be uneffectful in the end.

In paragraph 6 another outside of the box thought was put into words from Dr. Huang ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication...So computers need to understand that, too,"" The problem with this is that computers don't understand things, they are programmed to do what they are told. Only alive things ""understand"" which means to learn. If we put a program in our computer to read emotions then the computer will most likely only read that exact facial expression.

The use of technology to read emotional facial expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable because it is to far fetched and unpractical. This is because we have teachers, emotions change constantly, emotions are sometimes hard to read, and computers can't ""understand"" how a human is feeling a all times.

4DB817B0DE25,"As time progresses, so do classroom education and the technological innovations applied to it. While teachers search for helpful methods to engage their pupils in education, the world of science develops more and more inventions, such as the Facial Action Coding System, to improve standards of living. Despite its putative effectiveness in other fields such as advertisement or marketing, Facial Action Coding System technology possesses no place of value in a classroom and would serve as a hinderence to a student's learning process.

Although this software may serve as an effective source of profit for online corporations, it has no valueable place in classrooms. In the sixth paragraph of the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author illuminates the possibilites of success human-emotion-recognizing computer software provides in terms the world of marketing, describing how analyzing the emotional response to a Web ad popping up on one's computer screen can mold the variety of its future ads to a more preferred selection (6). While this software may be helpfully applicable to marketing schemes, its analyzation of human emotions would only deter from a student's learning in the classroom due to its possible misinterpretations and miscalculations. Verbal human communication is relied upon to determine what about a lesson plan confuses a student, and although a computer might register a student's confused expression and recognize that the lesson pace might be too fast for this individual scholar, the computer would be unable to pinpoint what exactly the student fails to understand. Other events may be weighing down heavily on a student's mind, causing their face to contort and convey the emotions brought on from factors outside of the learning setting. A change in emotion not caused by a difficult lesson plan would cause the software to possibly alter the lesson pace when the student did not require any adjustment and ultimately generate frustration in the already distressed student.

Although each day, more and more opportunities to develop and improve technology and learning are created, sometimes these brilliant innovations do not mesh well with education. Despite the proposed effectiveness this software can serve for marketing companies, Facial Action Coding System would only produce obstacles to a student's learning process, ultimately diminishing any value it could potentially possess in a classroom.",5,374,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions.

E4F9AEC51ECF,"I think that a Facial Action Coding System would be helpful in a classroom setting. I think this because it could show the teacher what students needed help by the ones looking confused or frusturated. This definitly could be a helpful tool when it is more available.

To go more in depth of how this could be beneficial to a classroom would be it helping confused students who are maybe more shy than others and dont ask the teacher for help when they need it. This program could be in their computer and then it could tell the teacher who looked confused about the work and they could go over and help them easier. Also like it says in the article ""Then it could modify the lesson, like a effective human instructor."" Which is another great idea!

This may not even just help the students, but it could help the teachers become better teachers. This could be done because lets say the students go home and 90% of them look confused or frusturated well the teacher could see that and could either explain it again the next day or make the assignment easier to do. Which from my experience of being a student that would be super nice to have.

Finally if the teacher was really dedicated to their job they could see if students were bored in their class, if so they could try to make it more fun. This could make students pay more attention in class and could increase the graduation rate and even the grade point average of students since they will be having more fun in class and would be more likley to participate.

I feel that it would not be as beneficial to students as the author makes it sound. At some point this technology may be helpful for counselors of schools but it is not for daily classroom use.

I am not saying that this technology is not an innovation. It is a tremendous breakthrough to the world of technology. And it could be beneficial to some professions and aspects of life, like psychology, but it just does not apply to students in the same way. The author says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"".

This is not true.

The only way that this could be true is if we replaced human teachers with computers, and that, i think, is a huge step in the wrong direction.

Technology is helpful to the world but to much of it may be a problem that is irreversable.

Furthermore, I think that this technology could be very helpful to high school counselors. With the emotional reader the counselors will be able to identify cases of depression or anxiety or other mental disorders found in high school easier.

In the article it states, ""we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day"". This is referring to the calculating the computer does. It says that we do that to which is true but we are not nearly as precise or efficient. That is why we need this technology or something like it for counselors, to lighten their burdens, but to also ensure that their job gets done.

93C1BA7B565E,"New technology is being made all around the world, that is changing society as we know it. One example of this technology is called Facial Action Coding System. Many people are wondering if the world should put something like this in schools so teachers can read students emotions. I think we should give this technology to teachers because this could help prevent casualties, and even the lack of school work students will do.

One reason I think the Facial Action Coding System should be in schools is because it could prevent casualties at home or at school such as school shootings and suicides. This technology could help prevent these casualties by letting the teacher know if a student is happy or upset. this meaning if a student is upset a teacher could get the student help or even help the student themselves by talking to them on why they are upset. For example students all around are getting bullied and not letting other people know how they feel or let them know they are getting bullied, so these students leave school being upset and they go home a commit suicide thinking they aren't important and thinking nobody wanted to help them. Therefore if teachers had this new technology I think teacher would be able to prevent this from happening by seeing how the student feels and therefore the teacher can talk to them and hear about what is happening. This will also make the students that do get upset feel like there are people out there that want to help them and that notice them.

Another reason why the Facial Action Coding System should be in schools is because the lack of school work being done because students are upset. This technology could help teachers get students to do their work or to even study, by letting the teacher know if the student is having a bad day. I think this will help because if a student is having a bad day then they won't want to do work because they are upset and just most people don't want to do work when they're upset, so if teachers had this technology I think they could talk to the students and try and get them in a better mood for themto do their work. Another reason why teachers should ge this because if a student is upset and they want to do their work, their work isn't going to beas good as if they were happy, and all teachers like to see their students with the best work.

There is new technology being made all around the world, that is changing society as we know it such as the Facial Action Coding system. This is why i think this technology should be put into schools.

Well now we have a technology that could read your expressions and put everything into perspective for you. But the question is, could it be important or valuable in a classroom. Yes, it could be important and valuable because it could change the way our classrooms operate.

This new technology could be vaulable in a class because it changes how classes in todays society work. For example the text states, "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. This proves that this technology could help a student if they show signs of being confused. Meaning that it could help a student faster than a teacher probably could.

So as you can see this tech could ultimately solve problems for our generation of kids. It would because it changes everything about how we learn.

F497369C41C2,"We all hide our emotions at one point or another but, what if we had the technology that could detect whatever were feeling despite if were trying to hold them in or not. The Facial Action Coding System or FACS is just that piece of technolgy that is capable of detecting any given emotion. Dr. Huang inventor of this software has even modified it to were it can find out any emotion or emotions all at once. It's been questioned should this kind of technolgy be used in classrooms for students. The Facial Action Coding System is valuable to students in the classroom because, if any student is having troubles on the actvity at hand the Facial Action Coding System could detect that modify the prompt and make it easier for the student to then understand. Second, this software could help you better understand someone and their well-being being able to see exactly what's making them happy and what's making them upset. Third, it's better way for human and computers to ""communicate or interact"".

Anybody couldn't say that they haven't had problems understanding something at any given point in time. Simpily because, everyone can't understand everything right away with no problem/obstacle getting in the way weither it being how the words are phrased or if the vocabulary is too hard to comprehend. FACS could solve this issue right away. As presented in the passage ""Dr. Huang predicts, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,"" therefore making it easier for the student or user to understand what is being asked or written. Solving probems much quicker than the instrustor could explaining the information piece by piece.

Understanding emotions when communicating with someone is key. Yet, we might not recognize all that are being distrubed to us. Another great reason for FACS to come into play. As stated in the passage ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" This is all very true we can't comprehend every emotion that's more dull or hidden. So why don't we get a little help at recognizing more emotions. With FACS we can better understand someones true feelings inside and their well-being. This can than lead to possibly help solving some of the persons unsolved issues and other ""troubling thoughts."" Helping them become of the better verison of themselves.

In our generation today technolgy is something that we live and breath. It's important that we become familair with technolgy and being able to use it properly and effectifly. ""Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for human and computers to communicate."" Now isn't this perfect? Huang can help us better understand computers and help computers better understand us. If students will be using computers 24/7 why not have the proper setup for them. If the software gets used in the way it's meant to it can overall have a positive effect towards the situation. After some time the computer can develop how the student or user works and operates and what they can understand and can not. Having a large postitive impact. Greater increasing the student's grades, confidence, and potentional in class. Allowing them to fully understand the content be covered better than they would ever before.

In conculsion, the Facial Action Coding System or FACS is valuable in the students classroom because, it can modify the content of the information to be better understood.

very few people want their emotions to be documented on a computer where someone can read them off of. in order for a computer to understand emotions, the emotions and facial expressions for a specific emotion need to be documented. that would make it easy for a hacker to hack into your computer and figure out what emotions you express to certain things. on paragraph 6 the article says,"" imagine a computer that knows when you are happy or sad. for example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a simular ad might follow. but if you frown, the next ad will be different."" not only will hackers figure out what emoitions you express to certain things, they can also figure out what you like/dislike or what emotions you express when texting someone.

20E320AA966E,"Imagine a classroom specifically tailored to each individual student and their emotion. The students there enjoy coming to school. If they are bored, the lesson changes to regain their interest. If they are confused, the lesson uses a different method of explaining to help them better understand what is being taught. The article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" describes a new emotion-recognition software that could do just that. The use of technology to read emotion is valuable and should be used classrooms.

The technology that is used currently in schools could be bettered using this new software. Throughout the United States, many schools are looking for solutions to better their classrooms. Emotion-recognition could be the answer. Most schools already have devices in place such as lap-tops, iPads, and classroom computers. With technology already in schools, why not strive to make it better? The only step that would need to be taken is putting these softwares in place.

Students could have more enjoyment and better understanding in schools with emotion detecting softwares. Those who find it hard to pay attention could recieve lessons that are constantly changing. Students that are having a difficult time with a particular portion or subject could recieve help. Even those who are commonly bored in school could be given more challanging lessons to keep their interest up, simply through emotion-recognition.

With happier kids and more personalized instruction, student's success in school could increase. If children had a more positive experience in school, they could enjoy learning more. If students enjoyed learning more, they might have more motivation to do well in school. Also, each individual student would be given instruction tailored to them, so no student would be left behind or have less oportunity to succeed than others.

Overall, the use of emotion detecting technology is valuable and should be used in classrooms.

EC9B3F68ECED,"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS)is a recent innovation in facial recognition software. It can deciper what a perosn may be feeling by analysing muscle movements and facial structure. While the technological impact of FACS is revolutionary, can a sytem like it be used in schools to give insight into the emotions of a student? The value of FACS in schools has the ptoential to become great, but as of now, FACS still has many challenges to face in order for it to become a practical and valuable part of the education sytem.

Currently, FACS can only recognize ""...six basic emotions-happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness..."". While this abilty is a great acheviment, FACS would have to be able to read many more expressions, such as confusion, boredom, or understanding to become useful in a classroom enviornment.

If implemented in its current state, FACS might look at each student's face and would be able to pinpoint only the happy or suprised students, but typically, the happy students are not be the ones who need help. Without the capabilities to recognize more emotions, FACS would serve little purpose in this setting.

The artical also states that "" Your at home PC can't handle the algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" Many school comtuters are out of date and wouldn't be able to run FACS either. So, in order to correctly use it, a school would have to spend large amounts of money to purchase machines with the computing power to run FACS, an investment that may not pay off for years. This expense would only be made greater by the cost of the software itself.

So, while the Facial Action Coding Sytem has the ability to become an integral part of the education sytem, with its current capabilities, it would seem that FACS is not yet ready to assume the role of a valuable tool in classrooms arcross the country.

DA486689B3EF,"The use of this technology to read students emotional expressions is not very valuble. No one can read emotions like teachers and peers can. If a student is confused or needs help they can simply ask for it, theres no need for a computer to tell what they need help with.

When some people are working on assignments on they often use trial and error and sometimes they just need to think about the problem before they do it. This could get confusing for the computer because when your thinking you often will look confused or you might be confused but later figure it out. You shouldnt have to rely on a computer to tell how your feeling to get help. Dr. Huang said ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, Like an effective human instructor."" This ay sound like a good idea but if a student is getting bored they dont need there lesson modified to help them and most kids are going to be bored during school thats just how the majority of students are.

One thing that would be extremly hard to control would be when kids make weird or strange faces. How will a computer distinguish between an emotion due to the lesson and emotion due to something else. Like when a student is talkling to there friend and they laugh or smile. A student could also try to look bored or confused on purpose just to get out of doing certain work. Another big issue is the fact that not every students facial features are the same. One students face could look way different from the faces that the software the computer was built to recognize.

The last reason as to why this wont be a very popular tool in classrooms is because most school computers dont have cameras and wont be able to afford them or the software needed to run the programe. Of course they could get special fuding for the equipment but theres way better things that money could go towards to help the students excel in more ways then on a computer.

Its a very interesting idea but theres just way to many issues involved with it that wont allow it to takwe off like they invision.

The system of recognizion is based to describe your emotions on certain things like as, if someone is not feeling well or if they need help with their work. We as humans, have a different variety of emotions that we can easily detect just by looking at their face. Most people will have the same face reaction all day meaning, if someone has a angry face and someone ask him if everything is ok, his respond is yes, is that his emotions and feelings do not interacts with his face reaction. In the Mona Lisa smile you can see like a pervert smile but at the same time, an inoccent. Determining different emotions associated with the facial muslces can truly help teachers to ditermine basic and normal emotions but also to see mixed emotions. As the Author says, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."", this means that not everyone will demonstraste how they feel in the inside, which not all students will have the same reaction during school and classes.

This system is really useful in my opinion, because you can recognize all emotions someone is feeling. You can recognize by looking at them but only 1 or 2. with this new system you can find them all.

Another reason why this system is a good idea is because even if the person is trying to hide their emotions you can still find it. This new sytem is a great idea/invention. this needs to be known. mor people need to know about this amazing idea.

All in all, i think this is a great system and they should add it to schools. It will help teachers and students. You will recognize every emotion the student feels. It can help lots of people.

95D641A74BF1,"I feel like the use of this technology being able to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not needed in anyway.

I feel this way because in the artical it stated that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (Dr. Huang). That could be useful, the computer notices that the students are bored and some confused, and then it changes to now the students that were bored and confused, now are amused and understand it much better. But the normal teacher that we have already can do that to.

As an example a teacher notice when students are bored, and then swich it up a little so keep things somewhat fresh, and when students get confused, the teacher will do the exact same things, swich some of the lesson up and explain it more. Just like the computer.

As somewhat of a side note, it also feels more natural to be taught by a human. Because its someone who thinks the way you do, understandes you better because they have been through everthing school wise as you. If I had a choise to be taught by a computer or a teacher, I would pick the teacher because a computer might know everything there is to know, but it would make me feel in a way, safer, because I would be talking to a human, something everyone is used to doing.

Overall, I state that it is not valuable because the teacher can almost do the exact same thing as the computer. Yes, teachers maybe not be able to tell that you are 65% bored and 35% confused, but do we really need a computer to tell us this information, because I feel like it would be a waste of money and time, if its something humans can already do and have been doing much longer than any computer has, humans are not as exact as a computer, but we can help out a student, and recognize that the student is confused or bored, and much more. We can help the student, just like a computer.

By being able to see and identify a student's emotions it could help see in what ways they could stay concentrated and help them focus at the task at hand, this is important since people usually have a short attention span, especially if it's something undesireable.

Not only can this be efficient for students but it also can be efficient for adults and anyone using the web. ""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different,"" Here not only is it being talked about the convience for people and their interests but also an advance in technology. Having a computer that can identify what you like or don't and tries to accomodate your likes and dislikes is a major technology advancement as well as a satisfaction to the consumer, here being students, teachers, as well as parents. The FACS is a valuable resource not only for students but also for people in general, it would help modify everyone's learning environment and how they learn things and this truly is important to the students, teachers, and parents at schools. The article goes on to say """"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" What's being discussed here is the idea that this use of technology could help improve a student's learning, the way they learn, their learning style, and keep their attention on the task as well as having them learn based on what they like and what keeps their attention drawed. The use of FACS to read students' emotional expressions seems to be very valuable in the matter that what's trying to be done is for the students' benefit and is trying to get them to improve their learning and cognitive skills based on what the way things are being taught.

The goal here is to make a piece of technology that's going to help computers identify and read the emotional expressions of students' in the classroom and help keep them from being confused or bored by modifying these lessons based on their interests and the way they react to things, being able to accomplish this goal will really help set these students on a more cognitive path that will help them be more successful in the future.

For example above your eyes, raise your eyebrows when you're surprised, around your mouth tightens your lips to show anger"". Finally this can be very valuable for teachers in the future because teachers can use that computer that reads emotional expressions on his/ her students to see their facial expression and tell what they are feeling this could help the teacher by making her class less boring, doing more avtivities, explaining more the lesson so students can understand and be less confused ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.

The idea itself at first sounds cool if your trying to figure a painting's expression (like Mona Lisa) but, using it on a student to figure how the emotions they feel when they're doing something on the computer (math questions assigned by a teacher or a reading passage, etc.) is just unessassary and weird.

My evidence to support the claim of how this isn't really useful or nessassary is on paragraph 6 where it all explains how a computer should know when you sad or happy or confused/bored.

First off having FACS in schools would get the kids excited to learn. The computer would adapt to their likes and dislikes so they would always be pleasing them. How would it know if they are really bored or confused is a common question, in paragraph 3 the text states ""the computer contructs a 3D model of the face; all 44 major muscles im the model must move like human muscles"" this all meaning that the computer can tell with 100% accuracy what you are feeling.

Secondly it is difficult for teachers to please each kid individualy and work with each child 1 on 1 and with this technological advancment it will give teachers a break and require them to give minimal assistance to the kids. In this day and age technology is becoming a bigger and bigger part of our everyday soceity and less and less people are wanting to become teachers, so having a computer do the job for them and do it just as good is remarkable. The author wrote in paragraph 6 ""imagine a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" this quote from the article showing that they would do the teachers job and be able to adapt and please each student individualy.

Lastly having this technology in every school would increase learning rates greatly because it would work in a way to help and assure learning for each child individualy. The problem with teaching today is some kids dont learn as fast as other and the teacher doesnt slow down to make sure they know what they are doing, but with the FACS program it will allow kids to go at their own success rate and insure they are really learning. And with all this the kids will learn quicker as a hole because they are the computers only concern.

46EB864A3362,"Facial Action Coding Sytems: Good or Bad?

People have bad days at school, whether it is from a home sitaution or just a bad grade. Being upset in school can affect your ability to preform well. This is why it is important for schools to have a Facial Action Coding System.

One reason why there should be Facial Action Coding Systems in schools is because it would help recongnize when the students emotion is low, faster so it would not affect their grade. For example, in the passage it says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson."" This proves that if the student can become more engaged then they will do better in school.

Another reason why there should be Facial Action Coding Sytems in schools is because it can give more insight into the student's home life. For example, if the student is having family problems you would be able to read it on their face with the coding system more quickly than through a human's eyes. Being sad could affect a student's scores and plummet their grade.

Finally, it would be smart and affective to have a Facial Action Coding System in the schools becuase it involves intense algorithims that kids could try and solve and maybe build one themselves. The system would promote science, technology, engineerng and math, which is very important. In the passage it talks about the types of algorithims Dr. Huang uses, ""His new computer software stores similar anatomical inforamtion as electronic code."" The coding Dr. Huang uses can be taught to students in order to further techonlogy in the world.

However, having a Facial Action Coding System could be a bad idea because it would not give student's the kind of action and discpline they would have with a human teacher. It is important for student's to build a bond with a teacher and to be able to open up to them. In the case with a Facial Action Coding System in the classroom the student's would not be able to have that bond.

In conclusion, it would be very benificial for Facial Action Coding Systems to be put in schools. They could help improve grades and give a better insight into problems a student may possibly be going through. It is very important to be able to read a student's emotion to help them academically.

The technolgy could tell how we feel by the facial expression and your movements of the facial muscles. They are looking for a better way for human and computer to communicate. The computer could model the face of the 44 major muscle like a human muscles movement is called a action unit. i don't like the computer to see our emotion because its like someone watching or i feel like someone stalking like watching what i'm doing. They could use in the classroom to see someone who is bored or confused of the worked. The computer could when u smile but we know it doesn't lie about what u feel. If u fake smile it could tell that ur not really smiling. They were studying the picture painting of mona lisa to see if it show the feeling what she have.

And you muscules on your face what it tellls us if your haooy. It also tells us different reactions.

In the article This computer FACS can tell us how your muscles can helps the omputer with the emotion you are feeling. In the article on paragraph 3 it says ""Eckamn has classified ix basic emotionsa-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movement of the facial muscles""(3). FACS loooks your face muscles to indecate what your emotion and true emotion in front of the video you are showing. It can tell if you are happy, sad or desgusted.

FACS can also tell emotions just like on your face musles. In the article in paragrph 4 it says,"" the new emotion-recogniton software tracks these facial movement- in a real face or painted face of Mona Lisa""(4).This new computer can even exam you emotions on your face like it did on ona Lisa. Also, FACS even works on painted faces. It can tell if the painting of the persons face is happy not.

680F4627E125,"The Facial Action Coding System is one of the new technologies of this century that is very complex and futuristic. It uses algorithims and muscle knowledge to discern the emotion of people in reality, photos, and other facial sources as well. The system can calculate how much you're happy, sad, suprised, and angry. Knowing other people's emotions is a great tool and can be used in many different situations. This new technology is good for a lot of things, and being used in a classroom is one of them.

Students need to be focused and engaged at all times in the classroom because if they are neither engaged, nor focused then they will struggle with learning new things and excelling in and out of the classroom. A computer in a class constantly scanning students' faces could become a distraction, but it would solve more problems than it could create. These days students are more vulnerable to distractions, and there are a lot of uncontrollable factors they are standing against. Some do not get enough sleep, some do not get enough to eat, and some do not have good health, whether that be mentally, socially, emotionally, or physically. These factors can take a toll on their ability to focus and be receptive to new information being taught in the classroom. They easily can become ""confused or bored""(D'alto 6) or even distracted in a class, but if there was a way to track the behaviors that coincide with those emotions then it would be easier to assist the students. With the computer scanning their faces students emotions would be much more clear, and, as D'alto said in paragraph 6, the needed adjustments could be made to help students pay attention so they can learn.

Many teachers find it hard to keep their lesson plans exciting and engaging because of their lack of resources, but with this computer it would be easy to recieve real feedback from students emotions on what they like and dislike. Moreover, even though the computer might present itself as a distraction in the beginning over time it would become a useful tool for the classroom, and be a huge asset for both students and teachers.

Dr Huang and his colleauges originally built this so they could find out how the lady in the mona lisa was feeling and they found out that she was 83% happy 9% disgusted 6%fearful and 2% angry. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is is bored or confused during a lesson and then using the FACS the computer modifys the questions so you arent so bored or makes the difficulty easier like a human instructor. The FACS constructs a 3d computer module of the face and all 44 major muscles in the module move like a human face and one muscle moves its called an action unit then the rest of the work is done by psychologists by classifying the emotion depending on the movements of your facial muscles.

In addition, it will clear up the confusion over mixed emotions concercing the classroom.

This new technological innovation can help open the eyes of teachers. If a student is doing an assignment on the cmputer and is very confused the teacher may not know because he or she is busy working with another student. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...""(6). Then once the computer knows the student is confused or bored, it can change the lessson toconform to them. This will help teachers teach kids more effiecently without having to change all of their material to help one student.

This technology also has the ability to show the multiple different emotions of a person. ""...the software can even identify mixed emotions..."" (4). No more will a face be wrongly recongized as in understanding or agreeance. An educater can use this information to understand the overall ratios of his or her students. With this technology in classrooms there will not be a feeling of being left behind.

People in this world always going off on what people say or showing them computers dont always be right , i would never go and get a computer to help me with my problems because they dont know everything plus why would you want it in the classroom anyway , someone can come steal it or anything you never now a days people is doing all types of stuff

But again i think it will be good for to be at school because when the students walks in the classroom they can just have them come to the computer and scan them to make sure they are having a good day and nothing is bothring them. Also they should check them when they come into the classroom because they probaly can be having a ruff day and just going to a hard time , but you can make them happy when they walk in the classroom ny, for example""

using the zygomatic major and different musle , the risorious "". But to be honest i really think its not a good idea because why you have a computer trying to sovle people problems when you can just have them talk to someone about it , it dont make sense to have extra stuff to help kids when its a soical worker there. They need to do something better with they money at the school instead of trying to by nonsense and bring it to the school. All tho they trying to help the children out and make them better or whatever they trying to do its not not worth paying alot of money for a mixed emotion computer when you can just send them to they soical worker .But the moral of the story is that no i would never but this comuputer its a good brand to the school and all but i would just not get one.

AF744782945F,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology, to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom, is valuable. I believe this technology would be great to use in a classroom. It would really help the teacher with his or her lesson. Dr. Huang predicts that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". If a simple classroom computer can determine a students' emotions, that would be a great assistance to a teacher. The teacher would then know if he should go into greater detail or if he should make his lesson plan a little more interesting.

Human Beings can be really good at hiding their emotions. With the Facial Action Coding System no one would be able to hide their true emotions. If someone was really depressed, but they portray themselves to be happy, this technology could stop that person from hurting themselves or others. If a school therapist or school social worker had this technology it would make their jobs so much easier. They could sense what the students are really feeling, rather than what the students want them to think their feeling. Also, the school therapist would know if the patient would need to be prescribed any medicine.

Another reason why the Facial Action Coding System would be a good idea is because, as stated in the article, it could reveal so much about the science of emotions. The FACS (Factial Action Coding System) could detect a false smile. If you are not feeling geniunely happy, if you are just ""putting on a happy face"" this technolgy would be able to see through what your false act. This new technology could become the next big thing. It would be able to uncover the truth about alot of people.

The last argument I am going to state on why the FACS would be valuable on detecting students emotions is that the technology could tell whether a student is telling the truth or not. The article states in paragraph 8 that usually when someone squint their eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the corner of their eyes usually means that their not being thruthful. FACS uses muscle clues to determine whether a person if being truthful or not. This would be great in a classroom. For example, if someone is being bullied and they tell the teacher but the bully says he isn't bullying anyone, this would be great for the teacher. The teacher would know which one of her students is telling the truth.

In Conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System would be a superb idea. This new technology would not only be very interesting but it would also save many lives. This technology could be used in many different jobs. It could also help many people. With this technology you would no longer have to take someones word on how their feeling, even when you have a gut feeling telling you otherwise. Rather than assuming what someone is feeling you could now know for sure with the Facial Action Coding System.

Our world today mostly depends on computers and machines to do most of everything. Many inventors and scientist have discovered so many technological things and as the years progress, we get smarter and smarter and come up with more discoveries. Since we depend so much on technology, its a norm to use it, so mostly everything scientist, inventors and doctors come up with is valuable or useful.

Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of this new technology the Facial Action Coding System, has worked with many other scientist and doctors to create this technology, that enables computers to identify human emotions. This is a very valuable technology that our world needs today. There are plus and down sides to this argument of the technology being valuable or not. It is valuable because it can be use for many things throughout the world, for example paragraph 6 states, ""A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This technology would help the teacher see what he or she needs to do to be able to make the class more exciting to make students learn and pay attention more. Paragraph 8 states, "" To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isnt being truthful."" The technology would be valuable in a situation like an important election, where if a person running for something is lying about something, you would be able to tell using the help of the FACS.

In conclusion there are many reasons why we should or should not use the Facial Acting Coding System. We depend on technology most of the time, so this would be just another cool addition to our collection of discoveries we already have. Knowing the exact emotion of your mom, dad or friend from a computer software, would be very useful to see if there telling the truth or not. You would be able to know how they feel about you in many different ways. This could be really great for the furture, for parents, teachers, leaders and more.

This technology in a classroom is very valuable. In the article to author says "" Eckman has classified six basic emotions--happiness,suprise,anger,digust,and sadness..."".

With the technology being there it can also be its job to help the students understand what they are taught not only by the teacher. This technology takes lots of stress off of teachers backs by helping with students,but not also tht if a student is embarrassed to ask for hep the technology knows their feelings so it could notify the teacher about that. This technology would make a big change in schools.

This would effect the studets in a couple of ways. First, it effects them by giving them a better learning environment because your basically giving your communication to a computer.

B07E96B9767C,"As a student, if I don't understand something in class, I will ask someone about it. Whether that is a teacher, a student, or a parent there is almost always someone who knows. If any one of these reliable sources does not know, I can most likely look it up on one of my devices that has the internet. If we were to introduce the new FACS technology, it may have unindended lasting impacts which could be detrimental to our society.

It was mentioned in the passage on paragraph 6 that "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modiy the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' ""

The first reason that it could be bad for our society as a whole is that it is not the computer's duty to explain how to do everything and to change to our will. While computers were made to help us, it cannot be our only source of information. On the other hand, teachers are st school for the sole purpose of helping you learn. It is their actual job to be there to help you learn things. While computers are a tool to help achieve this goal, there are other ways to learn about things and get them explained to you.

When you are in highschool, many teachers and parents will say things to you along the lines of ""In the real world"" and "" Highschool is preparing you for the real world"". Later on in life, ""in the real world"", if you get bored at a job you cannot just change what you are doing. You have to continue on with it because it is your job. If we implemented this system now in schools, many kids and teens would get in their mindset that if they are bored or don't understand something, things will change for them. Kids should not rely on a computer to help them understand everything. There are teachers, classmates, parents, and other adults who can help.

The second reason why this could be bad for our society is the accessibility. Not every school has computers and not every class uses them. If we were to implement this software, it could be giving an unfair advantage to the students who had acsess to it. There are still plenty of schools that may not have a computer in every classroom. Similarly, not all students and parents can afford this kind of technology. Because of how new and high-tech this software is it most likely will cost more money to be put into effect. This would cause the schools with more money to be able to get it while the schools with less funding and less money to be pushed aside and not get it. This causes the students at the schools that cannnot afford it to have a disadvantage.

The third and final reason why this could be bad for our society as a whole is simply that people may become less sensitive to reading other peoples emotions. Without needing to have face- to- face human interactions to see how people are feeling, it could result in a decline of being able to recognize emotions in facial expressions.

I learned a few chords on the ukulele this summer. I could piece together a song or two. Now after a few months, I can't remember the first thing about playing those chords. This example shows that if you learn something then don't do it for an extended period of time, it will take a while to relearn how to do it. Although reading emotions is nothing like playing ukulele, the same holds true; if you learn something, and rely on something else to help you do it, it is going to be hard for you to re-learn how to do it again.

People also have a right to privacy and some people may not enjoy those particular rights being breached. I am a person who does not let all of my emotions show. Other people may bottle these feelings up in hopes that nobody will see. If people want to keep in how they feel, they should be able to do that as it is what they want.

Because it is not the computers duty to exlain everything to you, not everyone has accsess to this kind of software, and people may lose their sensitivity to the fine art of emotion reading, I am in opposition of implementing this FACS technology.

The computer's also need to understand that most human non communication is non verbal there are muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus that makes crow's - feet around your eyes. But when you are not really smiling in a fake smile,the mouth is strecthed sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle,the risorius. These muscles clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity is fake smiling.

Although some may ask, why dont you just ask us how we feel in this class? Others might just nit want to answer the question. So it would be easier to just get your answer from a mechine that gives you the answer you want.

There are many advantages to this technology when it come to reading other emotions. When using this device you could find out if many students are interested in the activity the teacher is talking about. You could also find out if the are just bored to death that they just want to get up and leave.

This technololgy could help with many things in the future by getting rid of all the non-fun things that happen in classroom. If this technology was in high schools I think the way teachers teach thing now days would be way better. For example, when the author put the mini lesson about moving you face in different emothions that was a good lesson. Just from that I learn that just moving your face around in different emotion could make you feel like the face you just made.

When it come to technology about your emotions in the classroom i think it would be very useful.

EB51FF23A9FE,"In this article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"", this article tells us about how many emotions we have and how to identify them. In futuristic terms their has been a new software created to identify human emotion by just scanning facial expressions. The software is called FACD ( Facial Action Coding System) and from the paragraph it seems that it has various promising applications and for different industries. In my own opinion, I do believe that this technology is very valuable in so many different ways.

The reason why I suppport the claim of this technology being valuable is because, we can detect when something is wrong with a child or anyone for that matter. As it states in paragraph 1 "" She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"".

This software has a remarkable way of just identifying your emotions and putting it into percentages.

So say if a child is depressed this software can give us the information we need to see what we can do to help a child, teen, or even an adult fight depression. This software can help us identify with mental sicknesses.

In paragraph 5 it summarizes how we can identify our friends expressions by the look they have on their face. Later on in that paragraph it tells us a doctor named Huang observes the remarkable artist Da Vinci and how he used human anatomy to help paint Mona Lisa's face. Even Da Vinci had a code to use to determine the emotions of people. The point is if we use this type of technology we can help a lot of peole around the world to identify with them, to have empathy, and mostly to help them.

Another reason why having this software as a valuable assist is because, if we unlock the science of emotion who knows what type of treatments we can do to help people who face anxeity, ddepression, suicidal thoughts, etc. Their are so many possiblities to just an expression. We can figure out what's wrong with them?, why are they this way?, and maybe we can figure how long they've been that way ? This tool doesn't just need to be used in schools, this tool can be used in the hospitals, therapists offices, etc. I just believe we use this technology we can change the world and make it will little bit better.

In Conclusion, This technology helps us in many different ways. Like for example how many emotions we're feeling and rate them from greatest to least We could discover new emotions we've never even heard . Also we could give people therapy if they have anger issues, we can treat people who doesn't even know what's wrong. This technology can do many things and solve many issues emotionally.

I think it is valuable because the creator might have built it for purpose. But what I personally think, ""IT IS USELESS"". WHY?.Let me explain you.

Humans are making new machines. But who has the time to test it. Because machines are growing, but the civilization is busy. Some people can't give their family some time because they got job to do. If they're done with job, then they have to look for home. Stress increases these days.

I think this machine is valuable same as useless. Valuable because it takes a lot of time and years to make.

It said when you open up a computer and something pop up that make you smile the technology will give you more of that. Although, this teacnology is useful i think to some students it might be valuable because if they study about art they might think is useful and valuable to them. On the other hand some students might think is not valuable because they are not intersted in this techology and they might feel unsafe around it.

This technology Is useful in a way because it detect how other people are feeling,even when they are hideing their emotions. Facial Action Coding System can be helpful to the FBI because it calculat emotions and when they have a case where they dont know who is the cimial they can use this technology to help them out. Eventhough they person might not look like they will be the cimial but if they try to use this technology it might help them figure it out faster. In the article is said ""Most human communication is nonverbal,including emotional communication. So computer need to understand too."" Although, computer is the techology in our everyday lives it such be able to read our emotion. This teachology will work for the students who are going to study in the art file.

Facial Action Coding System could go through your private system which some students would not wan't that to happen. If it could read your emotions it could read through you system and how you think and feel. Some students will think is invase of private area. Some students will feel unsafe around this technology because they feel like it know how to read your mind and how are you thinking. Students ahould feel safe when they are in school and around the technology in school.

Therefored, this technology should only be in a art classrooom or to the students who want to use it. It will help some students but in another hand some students will feel unsafe around it. Although, this techology is useful and valuble it should only be allow to the students who want to use it. If all over the school use this technology the school might get intouble too because what if the students dont want to use it and also their parents dont like it; the school could get sue for that.

Wouldn't it be neat if we didn't have to tell people how we feel just think about it. But then again it may turn out bad cause we could lose so many jobs. Cause if we have a robot to see if we are sad or not we wouldn't need to tell people how we feel like counclers or doctors. Now if we did use facs it would help people way more to be honest but then again it may not what if it reads your emotions wrong and get sad mixed up with mad that could go really bad. It could also save expensices with the computer you dont need breaks it will always be there to read your emotions. One way computers could mess up what it dignaoses the wrong medicine to someone for being sad then it could possible kill that person or maybe it will make.

For example if a student is becoming confused or bored,then the teacher will know it, by looking in the technology. Then the teacher will help the student for her or his problem. Student can also use this technology for their family,friends and the people arround them,to know what their emotion or what they gonna do. For example if there's a man in your back and he's trying to hurt you,you can act quickly because the technology will tell you and you can run away from that man.

I support my claim by this evidence from the article in paragraph four,the facial expressions for each emotion are universal observes Dr. huang, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly).Using video imagery,the newemotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements.

Yeah, this technology will work really good for student. Also for teachers' and people who needed it. Becaus they can see what their friends expression or emotion if they gonna say somethin on them.

DCCF6739067A,"A Facial Action Coding system sounds like something that would be invented or created in the far future. So if there is a real such thing as a facial action coding system it seems that there aren't many negatives as to why it shouldn't be used in a classroom setting today. The Facial Action Coding System should be used in the classroom setting because it will show students understandment, interest level, and overall thoughts over a topic or subject. Also another plus is it could show students themselves something they may be interested in which they didn't know even themselves.

So imagine a class where there is a Facial Action Coding System on a computer for each student to use, there would be so many benefits to using something like this, it sounds perfect for a classroom setting. First of all, it would show teachers the understandment level of students to a certain topic or subject, so if there is a subject or topic in which kids faces were scanned for their feelings about that subject, the teacher could maybe improve or make the lesson easier for students, which overall would create a better education system for the sutudents in the class and better oppurtunity. The second reason as to why it would be valuable to have the facial action coding system int he classroom would be because it would show students and teachers levels of interest kids may have on a certain subject or topic. For example say there are kids in a class and they begin there science notes or studies etc., and some kids have more higher interest feelings than others on the topic, that can show both teachers and even students what they truly feel about science, and it can lead to helping kids making bigger decisions in their lives, such as whether or not they want to pursue a career with lots of science involved or not. The third reason to use facial action coding system would be because it is universal. From the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", it is said that ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" The facial expressions for each emotion being universal means that anyone from anywhere around the world can use this as a tool to help them succeed in school, no matter what ethnicity they are from, and if they look different. Also if this facial action coding system is universal, imagine how accurate it is. So it definetely would be valuable to classroom setitngs all around the world, and would creat greater oppurtunites for students to get a better education.

To conclude, the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable to a classroom setting because it shows understandment, shows interest, and is universal which could also mean it is extremely accurate and enhanced. The Facial Action Coding system has many benefits to it which would be a great help to teachers in a classroom as well. The Facial Action Coding System could be used as a tool to succeed to many around the world. And so overall, the Facial Action Coding System is great and would be extremely valuable to classroom settings.

6D1AF3566A12,"I believe that use of the Facial Action Coding System could make immediate impacts in a classroom setting. The idea of being able to see someone's inner emotions could show lots of value for teachers in the class. This machine, after being tested in the classroom, could be used to make even more accurate and in-depth machines that could go even deeper. All it takes is it starting off.

There are many benefits to having a machine that is able to accurately find someone's emotions. The applications in the classroom would help make the day for a teacher run smoothly if there was trouble with a student, or if there was something upsetting a student you could use this device. The value of knowing what your students feel could help mold a curriculum that would be the most effective for their learning. Paragraph 6 mentions that classes could have computers that could detect these emotions, and change the way the lesson is and mold it to work for that specific student.

There is no reason that the FACS shouldn't be implemented into classes. The FACS is just a more accurate way of processing and recognizing someone's emotions and feelings. We, as humans, are always performing this calculation every day, as listed in paragraph 5. We cannot tell every emotion in someone's face, as they could be hiding their emotions behind a fake smile, or hiding sorrow or sadness behind a snarl. With the FACS knowing the emotions of a student in class who is struggling could maybe help the student and teacher find a way to stop the struggle. There is nothing wrong with knowing a student's emotions so a teacher can assist them if they are struggling.

This understanding of emotions and the creation of lessons that could help with those emotions could help graduation rates for schools go up, and help the GPA or work ethic of a student to increase. These benefits all could come from knowing students' emotions as long as the FACS is put into a school's classrooms.

Some may be worried that the FACS could be unaccurate and tell wrong emotions, but claims in paragragh 3 state that muscles in your face also dictate what emotion your feeling. These muscles can also indicate whether your smile is real and you are really happy, or if your smile is fake and that your feeling something different. Trained psychologists and others in their respected fields have contributed to the FACS to try and help create accurate assumptions based on the muscle usage in a person's face.

The evolution and effectiveness of the FACS could increase with the help of its use in the classroom, and the readings could become more accurate and more beneficial to the teacher and the student. The FACS could be used in almost anywhere, but I believe that it would have the biggest impact in the classroom. The effect it could have enourmous, and all it would take is one computer software.

The FACS should be put in classroom, not only to further the research needed to help develop the software more, but to help students who may struggle with lessons in class. The FACS's ability to read emotion will benefit student and teacher when the time comes, all it needs is to find its place in the classroom.

This presents a problem for the education system, as trainer and trainee usually need to see eye to eye for progress to be made.

Fortunately for us, technology has improved to the point that computers can describe all the emotions on someone's face.

The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because a computer will not tire and therefore will be able to calculate emotions in a longer timeframe than humans, it can be more accurate than normal people, and it could actually modify different procedures based on the software's collected data.

First and foremost, the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because a computer will not tire and therefore will be able to calculate emotions in a longer timeframe than humans.

In the article Making Mona LIsa Smile there is a quote that says; ""The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang...(D'alto, 1)""

The quote clearly says that the emotion-recognition technology is computer software, and therefore can function for longer amounts of time than a normal human, which makes it valuable.

Secondly, the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it can be more accurate than normal people.

In the article called Making Mona Lisa Smile, there is a quote that states; ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements...

By weighing the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions.(D'alto, 4)""

Most of the time, one can really only make an educated guess at what's on other people's minds.

But with the use of the emotion-recognition software, one can accurately describe the emotions on one's face, which makes it valuable.

Furthermore he use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it could actually modify different procedures based on the software's collected data.

In the article called Making Mona Lisa Smile, there is a quote that says; ""A classroom computer [using emotion-recognition software] coul recognize when a stidnet is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.(D'alto, 6)""

The quote explains that the emotion-recognition software has the capability to modify the way is does a task based on the data is collects.

This alone makes it a very effective instructor, and also very valuable.

In conclusion, the use of technology to read the emotional expresions of students in a classroom is valuable because it can keep functioning for a long time, it can represent its collected emotion data as numerical values, and it can change how it does things based on this.

The tech indeed very valuable.

It could change learning forever.

The schools needed this technology to identify the emotional expressions of the students. Sometime things happen in school that the teachers don't know about; they don't know how their students are feeling. There are three benefitile about this technology. The Facial Action Coding System help the teachers identify the emotion of their students. The second is, it really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much the computer can do. The third is, it will help you tell if the person that is the most important to you is sad or happy.

The first reason is the Facial Action Coding System is valuable because it help the teachers identify the emotion of their student. It said in the article ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". Some of the students in the school won't talk about how they are feeling in the classroom, and some of them would be scared to ask question when they are confused. The new technology would help the teachers so much on how to find out if their students are understanding the works they did in the classroom.

The second is, it really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much the computer can do. Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. Everybody in this world needs someone that could tell if they were happy or sad, so they would feel like someone is understanding them at lest. "" Eckman has classified six basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"". These are the great things Eckman has classified that can help us and make us smile.

The third is, it will help you tell if the person that is the most important to you is sad or happy. Sometime we can tell that the person is happy or sad, but we can't not tell it all the time. We can makes the wrong assumption about a person by the look on their face.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is very valuable to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. So we need the new technology to help telling us about a person feeling.

Everyday we may walk around with expressions on our faces that shows how we feel or what you want to show others what you're feeling. Other times we put on a happy face but on the inside we're actually pretty sad. Dr. Paul is the creator fo FACS (Facial Action Coding System). I am for this new way of knowing someone's emotions just looking at a picture and especially through paintings.

Dr. Paul is the creator of FACS. He was able to identify variety of emotions in one picture or painting. Eckman have found the basic emotions such as happy, surprise, angery, disgusted, fear, and saddness. They were also able to identify mixed feelings. Some examples of knowing what one person might be thinking. When a person raises their eyebrows they are showing that they are surprise. When a person shows that they are angry their eyebrows point inward and eyes are focused intently at someone else. When we are with our friends we are able to know what they are thinking or feeling most of the time. We know when they are happy, sad, or even excited, this technology allows us to look into it deeper. Unlike our PC computers at home, it doesn't have that advance technology that can read our expressions. In the article is says that they would write dome simple codings to different emotions. In an environment like school it would be interesting to use this type of technology among the students. FACS would help the teachers to identify which students are paying attention and who are bored just using this.

In the painting of Mona Lisa they were able to figure that there was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguished, 6 fearful, and 2 percent anger. This technoloy can be helpful in many ways. It calculates emotions through movements in a picture and varies in different emotions, and are able to calculate mixed feelings. Some students go through some hard times and others may not see the things they are going through just looking at their faces.

114608C6747D,"Whoever thought that a machine could read a person's emotions? To our surpise, a highly advanced technology called the ""Facial Action Coding System"" is capable of reading one's emotion by calculating the movement of our face muscles. Some may say that this technology has no value and should be abandoned. However, it is clear that this technology has a great amount of value because it helps us better understand the muscles in our face, it improves communication between people, and can improve the quality of faces in computers.

First of all, the experts of the software are constantly experimenting on different parts of the muscles in our face. By doing so, the experts are better understanding the part's of the muscles. On paragraph 3, the author cleary states that, ""all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. This shows that the experts have noticed these odd movements of the muscles. The muscles function similarly to legs. Also, on paragraph 4, the author talks about how this new technology can even detect ones mixed emotions. The evidence that he uses is the painting of Mona Lisa. The painting was filled with different types of emotions such as 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.

Next, the technology has played a major role in improving our communication between people. On paragraph 6, the author shows us that most communications between people is through nonverbal. The technology can help ones understanding of emotional communications, thus improving their nonverbal communication. The technology can tell when someone is zoned out or just completely bored. On paragraph 6, the author states that ""A classroom computer recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". This machine could better the communication between teachers and students.

Not only does this machine improve communications, this machine can improve facial expressions in our games and our technology. At the middle of paragraph 6, the author states that ""The same technology can make computer-anmated faces more expressive"". This will improve the quality of our video-games. Video games will become more vivd and realistic. Also, in the medical field, this improves the video surgery. With a better video surgey, more lives will be saved.

Lastly, the facial technology will and has played a major role in our lives. This machinery is a huge technological discovery and should be continued. This is because the technology has helped us better understand our facial muscles, has improved nonverbal communications between people, and has improved the quality of our computer-animated faces. This technology can play roles in almost every thing we do. From video games to hospitals, this machine does it all.

Also I thinks what the sciencetists says on paragraph 1 ""Developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate"", this means that they said like it better for all people if they developing a software that can recognize emotions.

Another good things about the emotion recongnition like what it says on paragraph 4 because the software can also recognize faces on a pictures.

585B6471A19D,"Professor Thomas Huang of the University of Illinois has made a great leap in technology that can recognize the emotions one might project. With his collegues, Prof. Huang developed the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS. It utilizes human anatomy to help indentify the intensity of emotions and what range of emotions one might feel. As facial emotions are universal in the muscles that are engaged to produce those emotions, having this technology in different environments can help with productivity and learning. An application of FACS can prove useful in a school enviroment, as it can provide tailored learning, emotional aid through school counseling, and can aid in learning anatomy.

As proposed in paragraph 6, the use of FACS can allow for tailored learning through webcamera software. If the software can be used to detect the emotions on the faces of students, it can identify the emotions associated with success and frustration. If the facial scan sees that a student is struggling with an assignment or is frustrated with it, the lesson plan and the problems given can be altered to maximize what is learned as mentioned in paragraph 6 with Prof. Huang writing, ""A classrom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This application can aid struggling students and familiarize students with the given material, meaning that the students can further comprehend the lesson given. For students are exceeding the requirements for the assignment, emotions of happiness could allow for students to face a challenge with tougher problems than the ones given previously.

As seen in the paragraph above, FACS can aid in online learning, but it can also help with emotional help provided by a school counselor. Though it is a profession that entails the analysis of emotion in teenagers, emotions can be tough to read for even the most experienced in the field. FACS could play a big role in identifying what emotions students might have in the name of bettering their life. As mentioned in paragraph 5, humans can differentiate between various emotions when looking at the face of an friend or family member. However, the length of that analysis can only go so far to prove what a student is feeling. Employing FACS could help counselors talk one on one with students about what problems they face in school and at home. Talking through these problems can lead to a more positive outlook on life and could allow for more engagement academically regarding the student. As a whole FACS can improve school life and culture.

Lastly, FACS can play a large role in the education of Anatomy, not only in high school, but in college as well. Paragraphs 7-9 provide simple examples of muscles involved in movements that indicate emotions from the zygomatic major and risorius to the orbicularis oculi pars plpabraeus. Utilizing the FACS can help students identify major muscles and their functions by using different emotional expressions. Since emotion is scientifically proven to be evoked by emotional expression as mentioned in paragraph 9, the results of which emotions are present can be more accurate. Having the ability to identify and associate muscles on a personal level with the aid of machinery allows for the knowledge to be kept with personal association, making FACS very important in this field of education. FACS can help memorize those muscles and retain knowledge about their function from a simple facial analysis.

An application of FACS can prove useful in a school enviroment, as it can provide tailored learning, aid in school counseling, and aid in learning Anatomy. As explored in the paragraphs above, FACS provides a wide range of oppurtunities for schools to engage in different forms of learning and measuring progress with its aid. With a universal impact in many different aspects of school life, FACS can revolutionize what teachers and counselors think is best for students. The software provides a scope of use not limited to just science, but to schools and companies who can utilize FACS for learning and for projects in the future.",5,670,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions.

The matchine are exact and they are able to detect exactly how other people are feeling even when they are trying to hide their emotions. This new technology is the latest innovation from Prof. Eckman, creator of FACS has classified six basic emations. They are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. All of the emotions associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.

Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit"". The software read people's face and tell what is happening to them. Dr. Huang observes that,""The facial expressions for each emotions are universal"". For example, our frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises our eyebrows when we are surprised.

Using a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Imagine a computer knows when we are happy or sad. Dr. Huang predicts that it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructors. sometimes, it is hard for the teachers to guess the students. Human may know 50% of what they need acording to face emtions but the Face Action Coding System might know about 90% of human,s emotions by scanning their faces.

Therefore, the use of the latest software is good to express the emotions of students in a classroom is very valuable because it saves time and also can offer the students what they really want.

64EED50CD664,"In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" Nick D'Alto introduces a new idea of using computers to intepret emotions from facial expressions. Dr. Thomas Huang envisions a possibility in which online classrooms could use facial analysis in order to more effectively instruct students. However, despite the possible benefits facial analysis could provide online classrooms, things like privacy, practicality, and effectiveness are obstacles that must be addressed.

Privacy has long been one of the post important aspects of life. The same holds true for the internet as well. People value their anonymity, and they often go online in order to be someone else - someone different than they are in real life. Facial recognition requires access to the face, something many internet users are not fond of allowing, especially on the internet where everything is effectively open. Counterarguments might say that online classrooms could keep images of faces secret and secure, but every since the invention of technology, hackers, crackers, and similar people have always been able to exploit security issues and gain access to the databases with images of faces. Many people would rather no one see their faces and have no customized ads or information as opposed to having a computer know ""when [they're] happy or sad."" While facial analysis may prove to be quite a useful and revolutionary technology, many users would forever remain wary that their privacy (and their face) might be compromised.

Praticality also remains an issue for would-be-users of this technology. As D'Alto writes, not everyone's ""home PC [can] handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"" (and subsequently their own). Many would be unwilling to buy a more powerful PC simply to allow the facial analysis software to work. While most, if not all, people acknowledge that education is important, powerful PC's often cost over one thousand dollars, a price that many are unable or unwilling to pay for a convenient online education. Also, there remains the issue of the technology itself. How would it be distributed? Would it be software or would it be built into computers? Would there be a price tag attached? These are all questions that affect how practical this technology is. Imagine people empty their wallet of a couple thousand dollars only to find that the algorithm only comes preinstalled on certain computers, or is incredibly buggy and doesn't work properly. People might argue that users should educate themselves on how the system works before even considering buying the product, but often, for products like this, the information is woefully incomplete or exaggerated. Until the technology can become accessible to the average everyday user, it will fail to successfully be implemented in online classrooms.

Lastly, there remains the question of truly how effective it would be. Softwares relating to human qualities are often rather inconsistent and require extensive testing. Emotions are also a tricky thing, as people sometimes try to hide them or fake them. While D'Alto states that ""to an expert, faces don't lie,"" in a educational setting, that often doesn't matter. Most students are often relatively reluctant to learn, possibly putting their face in a perpetual cycle of anger, disgust, sadness, or even fear. In school, education carries on regardless of emotional state. While teachers do care about the emotional wellbeing of their students, they still must teach like the do any other. In general, emotions are often ignored in the face of studying and education - students study what they need to, no questions asked. This raises the question of truly how useful would facial analysis be in an online classroom? There isn't much computers can do to adjust to human emotions. Computers also lack a soul, so they therefore lack emotions and empathy and sympathy. Without those, how could they possibly understand what a student needs? Humans, as D'Alto states, indeed ""perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day."" However, humans can also react much more appropriately. Also, there is no guarantee that the technology would read emotions correctly. And unlike fingerprint scanners or facial recognition, there is no second chance with emotions. Either the computer interprets them incorrectly or correctly. The fact remains that having a facial recognition from an online, unemotional avatar simply would not provide many advantages over a regular online classroom.

Nick D'Alto's ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" provides a detailed analysis of a new, potentially revolutionary technology that could prove incredibly useful in future projects. Facial analysis has the potential to totally revamp our online experience. However, the online classroom isn't one of those places. Due to privacy, praticality, and effectiveness issues, facial analysis seems to be a ratherless worthless technology to implement in an online classroom.",6,771,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions.

B859B86268ED,"In the atricle ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the outhor describes about how a new technology called Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify humans emotions. I rather not be scanned by a computer to tell me my emotions. I don't think the Facial Action Coding System is valuable.

The first reason that I think we shouldn't have computer scanning are face because we need privacy . I wouldn't want a computer scanning me to see if I was happy, sad, tired, or mad. Example of the computer testing someone "" She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Also there's no need to know there emotions some people don't want you to.

Second reason is that I wouldn't want to pay for it. Some students couldn't afford it. Others could buy it but why would they they are at school to learn not know other peoples emotions. Example what the emotion scanner would do "" if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similarad might follow. But if you frowm next ad will be I different."" This shows me that you don't need it because all it shows your emotions anwhat kinds ads other sruff that could help you. There's no point for this if it nots helping you with school activities.

Third reason is whats the point of having this. It does benefit a liitle bit by changing stuff the computer to change our mood. Example of this ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" But rather than that it doesn't help us. It doesn't help us get good grades, doesn't show us what to do in class, and doesn't help your teachers eitheir.

So in this article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" where they other talks about compter showing your emotions isn't valubale to any school. The Facial Coding System is just showing your emotions not helping you in school. Its also probably very expensive some people couldn't afford it. Thats why I think its not valuable or needed in a school.

8DFB375E3159,"In this world many people or students were being suicide and some people they just don't have hope. Many people are facing many different kind of difficulties and sadness. For instance some people might be upset because they don't have families and can be because they are not as smart as other people in school. Some people are facing difficulties while other are living happily. But we people don't know how other people feel and we don't understand each other how we feel inside of our heart.

First,using this technology to read students' emotional expressions is valuable. The reason why i think it is good is because sometimes some students are not as smart as other students and some students are afraid to ask question that they don't understand and afraid to discuss with their teacher. But if we use this technology to read students' emotional expression in class, it would be really useful thing and meaningful for students. it would make students even better and smarter. As we can see in the articles it says""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" If all teachers use the computer that knows students' feelings that would also help/make student to improve and develope their knowledge. Second,some students keep skipping class it can be because since they don't understand the lessons that they learn, they feel bored and stress and they behave bad in class so it makes them want to skip class so that they can stay away from stressness. But if teachers use technology that can read studens' emotional expression so that teacher would know which student doesn't understand and confused the lessons and teacher can explain those who didn't understand after school or during their lessons. Finally if they keep using this technology,one teacher can change a thousand studens' bad behavor and mind.

2010E484FDBB,"The technology used in the article shouldn't be used to read students emotional expressions. They shouldn't because if a student is very sad or upset even angry you'll want to know why and probably ask them why they feel that way.

Some students might want to talk about it, but most probably wouldn't so it might make them even more upset or angry and sad if you ask whats wrong and they dont want to talk about it. Also if it a personal issue the student is having and they tell you what's wrong and you can't help them they might feel like they're doing something wrong and get sad or depressed becasue you can't help them. Also if this was used to read the emotinal expressions of students in the classroom I feel like it would be a distraction and take time out of the students learing to figure out how every student is feeling based on the facial expressions. Another thing could be what of the technology making this possible is wrong, so you walk up to a student and ask them why they're so happy but they are actually really sad. What if the student just changes their apperance to make them look a different way when they are read for their emotion. The last thing is what are the teachers going to do with the imfomation on how they think their students are feeling based on a facial expression. Maybe in a college where you want to be a consuler or something along those lines it would be a good thing to have to teach you how to read others emotions better, but it would be useless in a middle or high school classroom and just cause distractions.

This new technology would be very helpful and valuable in classrooms.

Being able to use this technology in classrooms could be such a help for some students. Since now majority of schools use laptops in the classrooms or they go to computer labs to work this could be a help. There are a lot of students that are afraid to ask their teacher for help when they don't understand a probelm that they are working on because they feel embarrassed for not understanding something that most of the class in understanding. Having this technology in class that could read your facial expressions while you are working could be a huge help.

D2887A8C6CE2,"I think having Facial Action Coding systems are a bad idea for students and regular people. I feel that it is a lack of privacy of what you think and that humans shouldnt rely on a piece of technology to change who we are, and as for this technology being for students i really dont think is a good idea at all. The reason why is becuase there could be students that prefer not to talk about there problems and this technology wont help them feel happier or any other emotion. Yes it will see that the person is angry about something but i feel that is not something to be said or written down for the public or teachers to figure out. If the student is ready to talk then the student will talk to you, not only that but thats what can create the bond between the teacher and the student and with that bond the student will learn to trust there teacher more better and for the teacher to trust the student better.

But with this technology, I feel like that would not be a good idea for teacher and student bonding, because then students would have a hard time trusting teachers because of the technology and if anything making student feel like they wont want to talk about there problems or anything at all because of the lack of trust that this technology gives them for teachers to figure out. If you want to know how the student is doing so badly then sit down and talk to the student about whats going on you should not need a device to detect what they are feeling. What would they gain from all that information how the students feel what is that suppose to do to make them happier making this sort of technology is a really big lack of privacy.

In conclusion i think having the Facial Action Coding System is a really bad idea especially for students becuase of the lack of privacy the students will have with there own emotions. Yes this sort of technology can figure out whats on there mind at the time but if the student is ready to talk to you about something then the student will open up to you making a better bond instead of having technology that pretty much forces itself to scan and recognize peoples emotions.",3,398,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions.

946C874A9CCD,"The science of emotion recognition is complex and is becoming exponentially more complex the further a topic is being disscused. In the realm of arguing weather the use of emotional recognition technology should be used in a classroom can be a very difficult tquestion. On one side, you can say it may invade privacy, but on the other hand, it could help teachers see if students are understanding the topic. The question still lies on which one is more important for both the student and the teacher. In my opinion, this technology should be implemented into classrooms internationally because it will help students learn more effectivley, but also it will enhance the teachers teaching ability when they know where they're students are going array.

This technology could be very benificial for students across the globe. The ability for a piece of technology to understand your emotions could come in handy. There are many outgoing students, but there are also many introverted students. Some students may not feel confident enough to ask for something to be repeated, so they may simply sit at their desks puzzeled for the rest of the class, while a simple question could've avoided this. If this technology is instituted, it will automatically know when a student isn't confident on the information and alert the teacher. By doing this, the introverted student won't be confused for very long and the topic could be revisited without the student to have to personally ask. It not only will help introverted students, but students across the board. Every student will benifit form this technology and will display in their grades. With this technology, the students acedemic achievements will expand exponentially. Becuase of this ability for teachers to understand their emotions, the quick turn around of revisiting the topic and teaching it a little differently could help the students absorb all the information, especially the information that they mau have not conprehended initally. This technology will be very valuable for the students for both their enjoyment throughout school becuase of the reduced stress, and their improvents in acedemic grades.

This technology is not only bennifical to the students, but to the teacher as well. For the teacher they will automatically know if a student is struggling and in what topic. Thius could be very valuable to create a strong teacher studnent realtionship where the teacher is able to understant the smallest change in emotion to when they're confused or if they understamd it. This relationship could improving the learning environment and how comfortable a student with their students and peers. This technology could help teachers in both big and small schools. In big lecture halls, it may seem to be difficult for a professor to understand the emotions of all the students sitting before them, they might not even be able to see everyone because some may sit further away. With this new technology, teachers could be notified when some students become confused and then revisit a topic. Small classrooms could benifit greatly to this as well. Althought they are in a closer proximity then in lecture halls, they still will have the issue of not understanding the emotions which could lead to confusion. In smaller classrooms the teacher could know what they're doing wrong and be able to fix this easily without having to disturb the students. They can evaluate the emotions throughout the lesson and then later, they can change their lesson plans to adapt to the confusion of the students. This is again, a very valuable piece of technology that could help the teachers grow in their profession.

Initally one may think that this technology is redundant and that a teacher could just help the student, and that it may be invading the students privacy. In reality, this technology continues to prove its many values, and it's evergrowing amount of benifits that completly overpower all the ideas that some may think its unnimportant. This technology is valuable to both teachers and students equally. The teachers are able to improve their teaching techniques and the students understand more in school. This technology, however, is nowhere near done. This technology can be further improved in many aspects. I could keep improving and always creating a smarter version of the present day technology, that may one day, change the course of education forever. This could be implemented in the online schools to understand if a student comprehends the information the value of this is unspeakable and should be institued in classrooms globally.

FBC1CA161C5F,"Using a computer to identify human emotions sounds good and bad. It sounds like it can be good in a way like if a friend was having a bad day and we didn't know what was wrong with them, we could then use a computer to help us. It can also be bad because what if a person doesn't feel like talking about a certain subject, using a computer to detect that humans emotion is unfair to that person, invading their private thoughts.

Im gonna support my claim and say it is not a valuable use of technology in my opinion. The use of the Facial Action Coding System sounds like an invade on someones deep thoughts and ideas that the person might not want anyone else to know. In my eyes a person's personal thoughts are very, very private if they want them to be. If we feel a certain way and we dont want to say it, that system totally invades the privacy of others. Again, in my eyes that is not right.

An example from the excerpt was detecting if we can see if a human is faking a smile or not. I get it, it would be outstanding to read everyones emotions, but at the end of the day its about what that person that is feelng a certain way feels about expressiong their emotion or not. If a human were to force a fake laugh and a computer shown that that was indeed a fake laugh, it would make the person who thought they were really laughing feel stupid, or upset. I am not saying lying is good, but sometimes its best to fake a smile for a better outcome of any situation.

As humans, making others feel good, or be happy is something we all try to do for others at one point. If we allow the Facial Action Coding System to enable a computer to tell our true emotions we may not be able to make a person feel good or happy. Lying is bad yes, but when it comes to making a person feek good about their apperence it is good to make them feel better about themselves. Like i stated before, Lying isnt always a bad thing.

In conclusion, i do not support nor do i agree with the Facial Action Coding System for any use at all. In my eyes telling someone they are beautiful, even if you dont mean it can make that persons day so much better. At the end of the day that is all it is about, making someone happy. With this technology it would be invading all human principles and person space. If a person does not want to talk about a certain topic, that is perfectly okay, drop it. Using that software in our computers to decet how they are feeling in my eyes is totally not okay.

A7B27F6C11A9,"It's FACTS That We Don't Need FACS

Being in school brings out a mix of emotions in every student. Wether the student is stressed, happy, or sad depends on many different variables. A student can feel these emotions because of a situation at home, a problem with a friend, and obviously because of the lessons or schoolwork going on in class. Can a machine truly and effectively montior these emotions? Is a machine like this really needed in the current education system? It's not, The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a calssroom is not valuable.

First of all, human emotions are complex. The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" gave us several examples of muscles in the human face that were used when expressing emotion. A couple examples of these are the ""frontalis pars lateralis,"" and the ""orbicularis oris."" Although these muscles and the parts of the face they move are an important part of dictating emotion, that's not all there is to understanding emotion. Body language is a massive part of emotion. The FACS may register a happy smile, but it won't see slouching shoulders. The text even states that, ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion.)"" This means the FACS reads a blank expression as showing no emotion. What if someone with a person with a blank expression is conveying emotion through body language? Being a student and teenager, body language is a huge part of communication. With the FACS not being able to read body language, that's already a giant hole in its value.

Next, how useful would this technology be outside of an elementary school setting? The answer is absolutely not useful. In elementary school the teacher caters to each students' needs. They're able to do so because you have the same 20 to 30 kids every minute of every day for 180 schools days. But, in middle school and high school students have seven to eight different teachers throughout the day. Middle and high school teachers don't have the one on one time to cater to their students. As cold as it sounds, middle and high school teachers simply might not even care about their students feelings. At least not to the degree an elementary teacher would. Teachers in the upper levels have a strict set of standards that they need to teach. Students must then master those standards to pass the class. There isn't enough time for an upper level teacher to care about their students' emotions.

Finally, students are kids. Kids experience a plethora of emotions throughout the day. Even though, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are unviersal,"" what would one use the information gathered from FACS for? Dr. Huang believes that, ""it [FACS] could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" The fact that the text states that FACS is just as effective as a human teacher completely renders itself useless. If Dr. Haung, the software engineer of FACS, believes that this machine performs on an equal level to a human, there is absolutely no need for the FACS. As previously mentioned, upper level teachers do not have the time to modify their lesson plans due to their students emotions. That fact alone removes the need for the FACS.

In conclusion, the use of FACS is not valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. The FACS does not have a place in the current education sytem. With evidence from the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it is clear that the FACS is only on the same level of reading emotions as, ""an effective teacher."" This renders the FACS not only as useless to students in a classroom, but also as a likely massively more expensive alternative to human teachers.

558BB83BB400,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" by Nick D'Alto, the author explains a new technology named the Facial Action Coding System which allows computers to identify emotions.

D'Alto uses credible evidence to prove the idea that this new technology is effective and valuable for students.

First, the author introduces the Facial Action Coding System and explains how it works.

D'alto talks about how the computer conducts a 3-D computer model of the human face, including all 44 of the major muscles in the human face.

It recognizes the six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness, and coordinates these emotions to the person's facial muscles.

The creator of FACS, who is a psychologist, further explains in detail how these specific different face muscles work.

""Your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprises.""

This quote supports the claim that this new technology is effective by exhibiting how the creator researched all of the human facial muscles.

Next, the author proceeds to talk about how humans perform the same ""calculation"" in day to day life.

By putting it into every day life, this makes the technology seem less far fetched.

""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face... artists such as Da Vinci studied human anatomy... and his new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.""

This quote expertly supports the claim that FACS is an effective tecnhology by bringing it to the everyday life scale, and using credible evidence to show the efficiency of the anatomical information the computer stores.

Moving forward, now that it has been established that this new technology is effective, the next question brought up is if it is valuable for students.

The author then explains how much value this technology can actually bring to students and how this new technology will be indubitably helpful to students in the classroom.

""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like a human instructor.""

This excerpt further proves the claim that FACS is valuable for students.

It brings the innovative idea forward and exhibits how it will be effectively used to help students customize their own learning experience.

The author expertly shows how the Facial Action Coding System could supercede the computers in today's society; it could very well be the future.

However, some people may read this article and see a few problems with it.

They may wonder how a computer can analyze everybody's facial expressions, if everybody's facial expressions are slightly different.

Fortunately, the creators have already thought of this problem, and conjured up a solution.

""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression.""

This quote refutes any ideas of doubt about this new technology, and instills faith in the readers that their technology will be valuable.

466692F9C4B9,"The Value of Students Emotions

I'm going to be talking about the technology that is able to read the emotional expressions on peoples faces. I don't think it's important for them to get that technology in class rooms. I'm going to be listing off ideas on why I think its not important for schools to get this technology. My first topic is going to be about how teachers are really interested in how the students feel about what they are learing. My second topic is going to be about how students usually give there opion on how they feel about there learning. My third topic is going to be about how they could use the money for something else other than that technology.

My first topic is teachers don't really care about how students feel about what are learning. What I mean by that is teachers don't care if the students like the topic are they just care about if the students are learning and understanding. Sometimes teachers can tell by students faces if they're liking the topic or not. Sometimes teacher will ask the students if they like the topic or not but they don't really care if they do. So then like what's the point in spending money on something like that.

Usually students will give their opion on the topic. I know I give my opion and I know other students to do to. Students don't want their faces to be scanned and told how they are feeling. I know I wouldn't want mine scanned. Everybody knows how they feel at school even teachers know how students feel at school. Sometimes teachers will ask the students how they feel at school and people will tell them the truth.

Schools could use the money for something else other than a face scanner. They could use the money for things that need fixed in the school. Like the roof it's been leeking they could fix that. Buy new things for the P.E. classes like balls or rackets. They could use the money to fix the cafetiera or buy new books with the money. They could spend the money on fixing the bathrooms or the lockers things like that is what they could spend there money on.

This is why I think they should not buy the scanner. I know it sounds cool and everything but I think it would not be a good idea to buy. It would be very awkward to up to a students face and just scan it during class. People won't like that I know I won't like that.

As humans, some of us may not realize how smart technology is really getting. The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify different types human emotions. Think about how this new kind of technology could change the world. This Facial Action Coding System could be incredibly valuable by reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.

In the article D'Alto states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson.."" With this technology students may be able to understand lessons more quickly and easily. This coding system could also help more troubling students excel in the classroom while saving the teachers time. By modifying the lesson, the Facial Coding System would also keep the attention of learners. This could train students to become exception learners as they grow.

It also states ""But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major muscle..and the risorius."" This tells the reader that this facial coding system is accurate on its reading by reading every single muscle on the face and correlating it to different moods. Because this technology is accurate, there may be little to no mistakes in reading a student's face in the classroom.

23C916766386,"I think that this type of technology could be very helpful but it could also be very scary if it isn't used properly. But, if it is only used for classroom use I think it could be very effective. There are plenty of ways this new technology could help schools help students learn better. Especially, if it could help kids learn the best way they can.

Face recognition is also used in the new IPhone X and there are already a whole bunch of new conspiracy theories about it. I think that is because humans have never seen this kind of technology used before, which can lead us to overthink and come up with crazy ideas in our heads because we don't fully understand this new technology. I feel as though Facial Action Coding System would get the same reaction at first which could probably affect schooling in general. Parents might hear negative stuff about this new technology and send their kids to different schools or start home schooling them, which would not be very good for the school's image. Of course, the talk would die down at some point but people might still be reluctant at first.

On the other hand, I think once all the suspicions do die down it would be a tremendous help to the school. As the passage was saying, that it could recognize if the student is getting bored it could change the way the lesson is being taught. I think this would help because everyone learns in a different way. It also was talking about if the student was confused and I was thinking maybe they could even just re-word how the lesson is explaining the material.

But, I do think the ad thing could be kind of annoying. Yes, it might help somewhat, but I, as do many other people, don't really like ads to begin with. Especially if they just pop up out of nowhere and onto my screen. It could help promote more things but I don't think that most people that are on the recieving end of these ads would be very fond of the idea.

In conclusion, I think that this technology could be very helpful ,maybe even cool, if used correctly and with a lot of testing and patience.

1C51F32A0689,"I believe that the use of the Facial Action Coding System is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom or the community around us. This technology would help show how others are feeling when they are hiding their emotions. This would help because since the Facial Action Coding System is pretty accurate, we are able to use this in future generations to specify emotions from other people and know how they are feeling to help those around us in the world.

When people are sad, mad, or even fearful, we can help those around us who are feeling down and comfort them. We can bring joy in the world by the people who are enjoying life and be with those who are happy by bringing those who are sad, mad, and fearful into the ""happy"" environment so they don't have to worry. Studies show in this article that, ""'Most of us have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys... specific emotion.' and also, 'Most communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' Dr. Huang predicts."" This proves that since not many of us in this world knows what our expressions are to see our specific emotion, especially during nonverbal communication, it would be best to see what their real emotions are and know what they are going through (or if they're just fine) and ask if they want help or need comfort. We could help out others who are going through things even if they don't need help. If they don't want to be comforted, we can always respect their privacy. But it would be best to know what others go through to respect those around us more often. We shouldn't offend and judge people in general because we don't know what others go through and how they feel when we do judge and offend them. It would be kind and respectful to help those out around us to make the world a better place.

This system would help to read emotional expressions in a classroom because it would help the learning environment and the students in the class when the teachers are teaching. This would especially help the teachers more because teachers have trouble knowing what students are going through and can help their students out during class if they need help when they are troubled in their subject of math, science, English, ect. Most of the time, students don't want to let the teachers know if they're worried about an assignment or sad about their grade and don't want to get help from the teachers. If teachers knew their students emotions, they would have a better interaction and communication with their students and help them learn better in class, understanding the subject more. Studies show in this article that, ""'A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored.' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like a effective human instructor.""' This proves that since teachers want their students to be successful in their subjects, this system could help students and especially teachers to know when to help each other out when they are confused on a specific part in the subject and have a better understanding in the subject when the teachers do help out the students. This could also help because when a student is going through something and is distraced in class, the teacher would know their emotion and take it easy on them during class and help out the student with their problem and what they go through to have a better understanding and interaction with the student.

In conclusion, The Facial Action Coding System is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom and the community around us to help those around us in the world and get a better understanding of people and their emotions to make the world a better place to live in by comforting others who need help and showing kindness.

In paragraph 8 it says "" But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways ising the zygomatic major and different muscle, the risorius."" however this may be true for most people; there has to be someone out there in our world of 7 billion that smiles there smiles with their zygomatic muscle or their risorius muscle. Everyone has diffrent emotions and everyone shows them diffrently. The muscles in our face does say a lot about the emotions we are feeling. I do belive to understand ones emotions it has to be very clear someone is sad, with tears, or you know the person well, In paragraph 5 the artical states "" For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on their face.""

In paragraph 3 it brings up ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, suprised, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"" but there are way more than 6 emotions that can be reconized.

The reason why we should use this is that it will help us cut down all the sucides and will help us make a lot more people happy. We would be ableto get helped in different ways then we do already now. this is a new piece of technolgy that could help our world in a big way but the only way we should only be able to use this is if the parents of the or the child if eighteen sign the waiver to tell us we can use it on them. This is a new thing that could help us in school and with everyone who needs help.

The reason why we need this is to help us get more with people trying to endanger them and to make sure everyone can feel better. We can always get help and do everything we can to make sure we have our students to know if we are cinfused or bored on what they are learning.

DA61A6F47A15,"I don't agree with using this technology to read students emotional expression. I think it wouldnt be a machines business to know how your feeling because some people like muself sometimes dont want to know how you really feel. For example. if I was feeling down one day about my dog passing away, and my little sisters want me to take them to the park. Im gonna stay as positive and happy as possible so it doesnt ruin their day. I would take them to the park making it seem like im happy, then eventually be happy myself after the fun we have. I wouldnt want some machine telling me or other people my emotions because thats my business.

Our emotions belong to us only and we choose for people or other things to know how we feel when we want to.

I am not the only one who sometimes hides the way they feel for a bit. We all know if you try to stay positive and have a good day that you will get over no matter what the situation is bringing you down. If you stay positive and happy, then it will all go away eventually instead of expressing how you feel and staying depressed or crying all day.

It seems like this technology can be useful or pretty cool to use on histroical people. Like who wouldnt want to know how Abe Lincon felt when he took his picture to be on the dollar bill. That would interest me by alot. Only because that is history and its very intersting, but using it everyday of your life can be really annoying and show less privacy. It is a good way to cheer people up like if a friend was feeling down and didnt want to tell you how he or she felt at the moment. That is understandable, but like i explained all you have to do is asume that they are feeling down and cheer them up the best you can and carry on with the day. Eventually they will be back to they're old self again.

Knowing how someone feels right off the top can be annoying for some people like myself. It can cause others like myself to feel very uncomfortable and not wanting to express how they feel because some machine does it for you. Maybe some people want to express how he or she felt a few days after they felt down or depressed. I highly disagree with thus technology being used in our everyday lives to see how we feel, although it would be very nice and interesting to use this technolgy on histroical pictures like the famous Mona Lisa or how President Abe Lincon felt on the dollar bill photo.

CC74792CC418,"The use of the Facial action coding system technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, because that would mean our technology intelligence is improving. The more improvement we get in technology, the more the world will change. The Facial Action Coding System will show how the person that is getting tested or is using this, how they feeling. What if your look is the opposite than what you are feeling or you, as in yourself dont feel anything?

The Facial Action Coding System can help identify the look you are given from another person. This technology wouldn't be like math homework, your science teacher grading your lab assignment, or a robot giving out data, it would be more like a clear resulting answer. It would not be a percentage, so that would help others who are younger and have yet learned about percentages.

The world would be controlled by a computer rather than humans. Computers can give out wrong data, for example, if you would determine to search something up for a project and it came up with different websites,(different websites can give different answers) like Wikipedia, it could give you a wrong answer and then you would ask your teacher or professor if your data seemed right he/she would be like "" This is not the right information"" then pulls out a book determining the answer to your question that gives the right information you need to complete your project. Anway, if technology starts controlling the world, who would control the technology? This will lead to another device and then another, then finally we would completely be controlled by technology/ electronics more than what the world is at the moment. the technology could have a malfunction and cause people to start worrying and frightened. sometimes your facial expression is different than what you are actually feeling.

In conclusion, the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System can be a good idea, but at the same time can be a horrid idea. It all depends on peoples perspective. Different people result in different answers.

1E9EBB2F62A0,"This technology is kinda dumb. We don't need this to be able to tell how a person is feeling. You can just tell by their facial expressions and how their moods are. Like it said in pharagraph 8 "" Muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes"". ""In a fake smile you can tell the difference between a real smile and a forced one because in a fake smile the mouth is streched sideways using the zygomatic mayjor and different muscle, the risorius.""

So no I really don't think it's something we need to be able to tell how a person is feeling. We already know how people feel when they're are around because of their moods and their facial expressions. I guess it can be a good thing to use for the people that are not good with facial expressions, they can use this technology to be able to understand how a person is feeling.
